//!
//! `swrite` is a tiny Rust crate providing the `swrite!` and `swriteln!` macros as
//! infallible alternatives to `write!` and `writeln!` for Strings. This is safe because
//! writing to a String never returns `Err(_)`.
//!
//! The implementation uses the `SWrite` trait. It is implemented for `String`.
//! With the `osstring` feature is enabled, it is also implemented for `std::ffi::OsString`.
//!
//! Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV):
//! - Without the `osstring` feature (default): 1.30.0
//! - With the `osstring` feature: 1.64.0
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! In `Cargo.toml`:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! swrite = "0.0.2"
//! ```
//!
//! In your Rust code:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use swrite::{SWrite, swrite, swriteln};
//! ```
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! Using `swrite!` and `swriteln!` with a `String`:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use swrite::{SWrite, swrite, swriteln};
//!
//! let mut s = String::new();
//! swrite!(s, "Hello, {}! ", "world");
//! swriteln!(s, "The answer is {}.", 42);
//!
//! println!("{}", s);
//! ```
//!
//! Output:
//!
//! ```not_rust
//! Hello, world! The answer is 42.
//! ```
